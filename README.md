## [IMDB - Searching, Rating and Reviewing movies !](https://localhost:8081)

Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹
This is my first self-learned FullStack project!
the main purpose of this project is practice code that includes both the client and the server side, and also working with web servers and databases.

The client side is written with javascript, css and ReactJS (including materialUI) while using GraphQL and react-apollo.
The sever is written with GO (including ent and gqlgen) and the database we use is is MySQL.

_I am not associated with nor speak for IMDB site._

_The main welcome page's photo Belong to NETFLIX inc._ 

_Notice That Im currently working on the app, so NEW FITCHERS are been added on daily basics!_
